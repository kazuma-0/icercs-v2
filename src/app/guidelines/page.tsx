          Plagiarism can be identified even if the amount of plagiarized
          material varies. Proper citation alone is not sufficient to avoid
          plagiarism charges if specific material is not clearly identified.
          Paraphrasing must be done correctly, with proper citation, to avoid
          plagiarism.
        </p>
        <p className='mt-4 font-semibold'>
          In summary, while the amount of plagiarized material affects the
          corrective action, the presence of plagiarism is determined by the
          proper use of citations, quotation marks, and offset text.
